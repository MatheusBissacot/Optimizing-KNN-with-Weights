# KNN Optimization for Class Imbalance

## Description

This project aims to use a base version of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a well-known and established classification algorithm, and optimize it to address class imbalance issues in binary classification tasks.

## Features

- Fetch datasets from OpenML and convert them into Pandas DataFrames.
- Analyze class imbalances in selected datasets.
- Visualize the number of occurrences in each target class to confirm binary class imbalances.
- Implement and optimize the KNN algorithm for handling class imbalances.
